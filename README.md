# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to identify ride sharing metrics for fares by city type (urban, suburban, and rural) and measure and identify key metrics that could help Pyber improve accessibility to ride sharing and affordability to underserved neighborhoods.  

**Results**

In the screenshot below, the PyBer Summary DataFrame displays the total rides, drivers, fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver across three city types: Rural, Suburban, Urban. The Rural city type has the least amount of "Total Rides", but has the highest "Average Fare per Ride" ($34.62) and has the highest "Average Fare per Driver" ($55.49). The total volume of rides, drivers and fares is significantly lower in Rural cities compared to the overall totals for Suburban and Urban city types.

*Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types on a weekly basis* 

PyBer data between the months of January - April 2019 is shown below in a multiple line plot. The graph captures weekly Fare($) fluctuations by city type across a four month period.

The total Fare($USD) of rides by city type further helps explain the need for more Rural drivers. The overall volume between the months of January - April 2019 of Suburban fares (above $500 - $1,500) and Urban fares ( > $1,500) is significantly higher than Rural cities because of the higher volume of drivers and the larger demand for rides. From the data, it looks like there's a saturation of total drivers wthin Urban city types that could help serve Rural city types in order to drive fare prices down. 



**Summary**

Rural cities right now seem to have the fewest rides, but at the highest cost overall to rider and driver. If the number of drivers increase for Rural cities, then more potential transactions could take place, driving the demand up and cost down. While Urban cities have the highest centralized volume of rides, their fares are the least expensive overall to both rider and driver, making it more desirable for drivers to give quicker rides within the day vs. driving longer distances with the hopes of incurring larger (less frequent) tips. 

If there were more drivers allocated to servicing Rural areas in the months of February 2019 and March 2019, then the total fare per ride cost could have reduced considering there was already a clear demand for PyBer. 

 *Recommendations to the CEO*
 
Create and design a new incentive plan for encouraging drivers to position their rides in Rural cities so that the overall cost per ride could decrease as the volume of drivers increase meeting its ride demand. With a new incentive package for PyBer employees, it could motivate employees to drive in fewer trips (to serve Rural cities) while not only making the hourly wage, but adding an incentive bonus on top of their hourly wage to help improve accessibility to ride sharing and affordability to underserved neighborhoods.
